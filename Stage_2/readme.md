## Stage 2: Advanced C++ Programming

This folder contains code files that cover various advanced topics in C++ programming. The following topics are covered:

# Class and Object Definition
< > This code file covers the basics of defining classes and objects in C++. Classes are a way to encapsulate data and behavior, and objects are instances of classes.

# Access Specifiers
< > This code file covers the different access specifiers in C++, which are used to control the visibility of data and functions within a class. The three access specifiers are private, protected, and public.

# Constructors and Destructors
< > This code file covers constructors and destructors in C++. Constructors are special functions that are called when an object is created, and destructors are special functions that are called when an object is destroyed.

# Member Functions and Data Members 
< > This code file covers member functions and data members in C++. Member functions are functions that are defined within a class and can access the data members of the class. Data members are variables that are defined within a class and can be accessed by member functions.

# Inline Functions
< > This code file covers inline functions in C++. Inline functions are functions that are expanded in place by the compiler, rather than being called like a regular function. This can lead to performance improvements in certain situations.

# Static Members
< > This code file covers static members in C++. Static members are members of a class that are shared by all instances of the class. This can be useful for defining class-wide constants or counting the number of instances of the class.

# Friend Functions and Classes
< > This code file covers friend functions and classes in C++. Friend functions and classes are functions and classes that are granted access to the private and protected members of a class.

# Nested Classes
< > This code file covers nested classes in C++. Nested classes are classes that are defined within another class. They can be used to encapsulate related functionality and data within a larger class.

# Const Objects and Member Functions
< > This code file covers const objects and member functions in C++. Const objects are objects that are declared as const and cannot be modified. Const member functions are member functions that are declared as const and cannot modify the data members of the class.

 NOTE -> Each topic is covered in a separate code file. The code files are named after the topic they cover, and have the .cpp extension.
