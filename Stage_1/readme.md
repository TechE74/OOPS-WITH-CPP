# Basics of C++
T
his folder contains multiple code files that cover the basics of C++ programming language. The following topics are covered:

1 -> Basic Syntax and Semantics

2 -> Variables and Data Types

3 -> Operators and Expressions

4 -> Control Structures

5 -> Functions

6 -> Pointers and References

7 -> Dynamic Memory Allocation

Each topic is covered in a separate code file. The code files are named after the topic they cover, and have the .cpp extension. For example, the file variables_data_types.cpp covers the topic of Variables and Data Types.

# How to Run the Code

To run the code files, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system. One popular compiler is g++ which is available on most Unix-based systems.

# To compile and run a code file, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the code file. Then run the following commands:

# g++ <filename>.cpp -o <filename>   (compilation code)
# ./<filename>                       ( run compiled file command )


For example, to compile and run the Basics.cpp file, run the following commands:

g++ Basics.cpp -o basics
./basics

This will compile the code file and create an executable file with the same name as the code file (minus the .cpp extension). The second command runs the executable file, and you should see the output of the program on your screen.

# Contributing

If you find any errors in the code files, or if you would like to contribute additional code files that cover other topics in C++, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
