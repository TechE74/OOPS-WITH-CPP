# Inheritance 
 It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. In this section, we will cover the basics of inheritance, including how to create a subclass and how to override inherited methods.

# Access Control and Inheritance
 Access control is an important aspect of inheritance, as it determines which members of the base class can be accessed by the derived class. In this section, we will explore the various access control keywords in C++, including public, private, and protected.

# Protected Members Inheritance
 Protected members are a special type of member in C++ that can be accessed by the derived class but not by the outside world. In this section, we will discuss how to inherit protected members from a base class.

# Constructors and Destructors in Derived Classes
 Constructors and destructors play an important role in object-oriented programming, and they are no exception in derived classes. In this section, we will cover how to create constructors and destructors in derived classes and how to call the base class constructors and destructors.

# Types of Inheritance
 Inheritance can take on several different forms, depending on how the classes are related to each other. In this section, we will cover the four types of inheritance: single, multiple, multi-level, and hybrid.

## Single Inheritance
 Single inheritance is the simplest form of inheritance, where a derived class inherits from a single base class.

## Multiple Inheritance
 Multiple inheritance allows a derived class to inherit from multiple base classes, which can be useful in certain situations but can also lead to ambiguity.

## Multi-Level Inheritance
 Multi-level inheritance involves a chain of inheritance, where a derived class inherits from a base class, which in turn may inherit from another base class.

## Hybrid Inheritance
 Hybrid inheritance combines multiple inheritance with single or multi-level inheritance, allowing for complex class hierarchies.

# Virtual Base Classes
 Virtual base classes are a special type of base class that allows multiple inheritance without duplicating the inherited members. In this section, we will discuss how to use virtual base classes and their potential drawbacks.

# Conclusion
 Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows for code reuse and efficient class hierarchies. By understanding the various types of inheritance and access control in C++, you can create robust and maintainable code.
